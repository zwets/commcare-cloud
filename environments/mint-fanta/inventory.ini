#ufw_private_interface=eth0
# If ufw_private_interface is defined, then UFW will be enabled with all
# incoming allowed on this interface only, and all else denied except on
# proxy, where additionally 22, 80, 443, 60000-61000 (mosh) are open.
# See: docs/source/reference/howto/firewall.rst
# Since we are in a local container behind the reverse proxy on the host,
# we can have all ports open and disable UFW.  However when is_monolith
# is true, then deploy_common.yml enables UFW even if ufw_private_interface
# is unset (and opens up the public ports only).
# Zwets changed that condition to "is_monolith AND not behind_reverse_proxy",
# so that UFW remains disabled in our type of setup.
